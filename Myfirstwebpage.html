        <p style=" font-family:Verdana; font-size: 19px;">The wind rippled persistently against the tarpaulin draped over the outside door. It woke him up. He ran into his parent's room and jumped on the mattress. Flustered and still half asleep, his parents get up and guide the boy into the big room. 

        Waiting for him on the table is a present covered in a cloth with the number 7 written on the front. A present. Eagerly the boy opens the parcel to find an enormous book. 'Animals of the World', says the cover. This was not a surprise to him, every other person at his school had got the same book when they turned seven but he could still hope that maybe it would be different. "Thanks", he said. He hoped it didn't sound ungrateful. But he had wished maybe his 7th birthday would be different.  He started to get ready for The Visit. He knew this was coming too, although he was full of suspicion as to what it involved. 

        Thick mud covered the ground. Ever growing puddles made the path treacherous to walk. Other kids who also were turning seven appeared from the shacks that lined the road. All were walking with a sense of urgency and joy toward the tall building that loomed in the distance. It was barely visible through the low fog but you could still see the great chains of smoke coming out the top of the building and rising into the atmosphere as well as the occasional helicopters that went by which would fly low to keep out of sight from the outsiders around the edge of city. The sound was deafening.

        As the boy got closer he could see a long queue of other kids waiting to get in. He merged with the line of kids and waited for a long time. One by one the kids entered the building. Every boy, every girl had just turned seven. When his turn came, the boy entered the dark door. Along echoing hallways, downstairs into the depths of the building and upstairs into the heavens went the boy. It was bigger than it looked from the outside. He came upon a room. The room had a red cushioned chair which looked fit for a King and a table with lollies and a fanta on it. The room was also full of posters about the government. The chairman smiling and waving. It made him think that they were trying to make him feel a certain way, but he wasn't sure. 


        Suddenly, an alarm went off and a bright green light appeared on the floor. "Evacuate now", "Evacuate now", with a big arrow pointing to the door what could this mean? Out of fright he jumped up and started to run back down the hallways and stairs following the arrows until the outside came into view. Once he was outside he could see no one. The woman who let the kids in wasn't there and all the kids were gone. The street was empty. neither were the kids waiting to be let in. 

        The boy then turned around and began walking on home.
